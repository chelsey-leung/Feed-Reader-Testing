# Feed Reader Testing
This is my project of Udacity Front-end Developer Program. The purpose is to testing the code by using Jasmine.

# How to use
You need to open index.html and the testing will be run automatically. Once the testing is finished, the result will be show at the bottom of the page and you can modify the code based on the comment from Jasmine.
